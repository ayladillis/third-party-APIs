## Objective 
Build a day planner for an eight hour work day that displays the current date and time at the top of the page. Attach a save button next to each text box to save hourly memos into local storage as well as create a function that changes the text box color depending on what time it is; gray for the past, red present and green for future. Add unique styling!
